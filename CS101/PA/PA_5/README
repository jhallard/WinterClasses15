This is the README file for programming assignment #5, CMPS 101 at UCSC during Winter quarter, 2015.
This project contains the following files

List.c
===================
This file defines the list data type, a doubly-linked list with an associated node data-type also defined. 

List.h
===================
This file declares the list struct and its associated interface functions. This data structure includes a cursor which allows one to iterate over the contents of the list.

Graph.c
====================
Definition of the GraphObj data structure, including its members and associated functions.

Graph.h
====================
Declaration of the Graph data type, which is based off of the GraphObj defined in Graph.c This file exports all publically available data/functionality to the client.

GraphTest.c
====================
This is a simple test file for the Graph datatype. We add a bunch of edges to a large graph and perform some BFS runs on them.

FindComponents.c
====================
This file defines the FindComponents command line utility. This utility takes in two arguments, an input file and an output file. The input file defines structure of a directed graph over a set of contiguous interger vertices. It then performs DFS twice using a special algorithm to find the strongly connected components of the graph. These components are printed to the output file.

README.txt
====================
This file that you are reading, description of the project.

Makefile
====================
Builds all of the necessary components for this project
